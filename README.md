# Wall Beater
Based on the Atari game "Breakout", where the player's goal is to break down as many of the displayed bricks as possible using a single ball.

## Description
Wall beater is a game consisting of a block of bricks that the player has to break
 down using a single ball.
There are in total six rows of bricks, each row being a different color. If the
 player breaks a brick in the first row, he earns one point. The number of points
  to be earned increases as the player breaks a brick of a higher row. The player's
   goal is to hit as many of the bricks as possible (and thus earn as many points
    as possible), by using the ball which bounces back and forth between the wall
     of bricks and a paddle located at the bottom of the screen. If the player fails
      to bounce the ball using the paddle, he/she loses the game.
